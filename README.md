# AI-Link

## Introduction
AI-LINK is a Byzantine-Robust Circuit designed to ensure privacy and data sovereignty. It leverages smart contracts to connect Polkadot's storage and computing resources, enabling secure AI training and applications while safeguarding the user's original data from exposure.

## Features planned for the Hackathon

1. **Decentralized Model Verification**: We plan to implement blockchain-based smart contracts to verify the integrity of local and global model hashes, ensuring no tampering occurs during the update process.

2. **Confidential Aggregation**: Our goal is to utilize TEEs for creating a secure environment to validate local models and perform similarity checks, allowing detection of any malicious models submitted by participants.

3. **Privacy-Preserving Local Training**: We aim to enable clients to train models locally on their devices, ensuring raw data remains private while only encrypted models are shared for aggregation.

4. **Global Model Distribution**: After aggregation, a new global model will be securely distributed to clients, enabling continued collaboration and training with all participants.

5. **Transparent Model Evolution**: We'll log all model updates and verifications on the blockchain to ensure transparency and traceability throughout the hackathon.
